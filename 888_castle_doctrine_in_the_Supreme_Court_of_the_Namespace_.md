Castle doctrine for Urbit is the simple idea that the `$gang` interface in arvo's current peek implementation is a lie (as revealed by encrypted remote scry work) and that there are two modalities for any namespace binding in practice. Public and private. Only public bindings are accessible over Ames. Every public binding is accessible over Ames. Private bindings should, under no circumstance, ever leave the ship. We call the set of private bindings the "motte" and the set of public bindings the "bailey".
To share private data from the motte, encrypt it and post it in the bailey. 
Consider the namespace /shut which looks like this. (nb: shut path is (rendered to text /  jammed) and encrypted, to avoid leaking the structure of the namespace) (this is mostly a recapitulation of the directed messaging and encrypted remote scry work)


* `/shut/chum/[ship]/[...shut-path]` DH 

* `/shut/key/[ship]/[key-id]/[...shut-path]` Manual key exchange

* xx: key exchange over hyperscry?


TODO: what is API for key manipulation/rotation, tie into pug theory and rhizomatic (many-rooted) shrubs
